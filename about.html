            <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>Pachamama, the goddess of the Incas, was the goddess of the earth. She was also the earth itself. Pachamama Collectivo is a collective that brings together natural artists. We bring together 6-10 for a month in a location grounded in specific types of nature to vibrate the souls of our collective artists.</p>
            <p>For those of us who go to the end of the earth for our art.</p>
            <p>Individual Aritsts all know the struggle of how hard it is to chase the beauty required for great art. Convincing anyone to go with you to an exotic locale so you can take a single picture is a hard sell for a friend or a partner, much less a group. Not to mention the cost. Flights, hotels, and all for a single weekt to risk getting the shot,.

Spending tons of $$$ for only a single week in a remote location. And then when you show up it's a roll of the dice if we get good weather, conditions, and the lay of the land. Many times the shot never materilizes. 
            <p>We get together 1-2 times a year in awe inspiring beautiful locations. Let's build a community that last a lifetime.</p>
